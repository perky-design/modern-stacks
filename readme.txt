System font stack CSS organized by typeface classification for every modern OS.

== Description ==

The Modern Stacks plugin registers the Modern Stacks font collection in the font library, offering the fastest fonts available. This ensures no downloading, no layout shifts, and no flashes â€” just instant renders.

To install one or more fonts from this font collection:

1. Go to Appearance -> Editor -> Styles
2. Edit the Global Styles
3. Open the Typography settings -> Manage Fonts
4. Go to the Modern Stacks tab -> Select font -> Mark checkbox -> Install

After installing any of the Modern Stacks fonts, the installed font can be used anywhere a font can be selected in the editor.
